Java Programming Project â€“ Object-Oriented Design & Recursion
Implemented multiple Java classes (MathFunction, BankAccount, Student, Book, and Library) using encapsulation and clean design. Rewrote methods by converting recursion to iteration and vice versa for efficient computation. Built test classes to validate functionality, including grade averaging, account management, and a searchable book library.
