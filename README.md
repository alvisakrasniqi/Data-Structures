Java Programming Project â€“ Object-Oriented Design & Recursion
Implemented multiple Java classes (MathFunction, BankAccount, Student, Book, and Library) using encapsulation and clean design. Rewrote methods by converting recursion to iteration and vice versa for efficient computation. Built test classes to validate functionality, including grade averaging, account management, and a searchable book library.


Manually implemented a singly linked list using custom node classes, supporting core operations like add, reverse, merge, and isSorted, with attention to encapsulation and efficiency. Built generic data structures including a QueuedStack<T> using a single queue and a StackifiedQueue<T> using two stacks, each replicating standard stack and queue behaviors. Developed test classes to validate functionality across multiple data types.
